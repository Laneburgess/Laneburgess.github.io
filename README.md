# portfolio-stub
Stub site for use with an intro to GitHub sans Command Line. All editing is done in browser. 

Note - if you have already created an account and verified it you can skip to step three after logging in.

Steps:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/join. You want your username to be descriptive of your digital identity. This will become your domain, so be mindful of that. For example, my GitHub username is walshbr.

n.b. - if you already have a GitHub account you can check in with us.

2. Verify your email address by clicking the link in the email you received.

3. Go to [this link](https://github.com/walshbr/portfolio-stub/): https://github.com/walshbr/portfolio-stub/

4. Click the fork button in the top right to copy the stub portfolio to your GitHub account. You'll be redirected to a new page after you're done.

5. Click the gear icon to access the "settings" for your new repository. In there, search for "repository name" and change it from "portfolio-stub" to be <username>.github.io, where <username> is your unique username. I.e., if your username is reedeth on GitHub your repository name would be reedeth.github.io. Click rename.

6. Click back to the "code" tab.

7. Click on index.html and make a change to it - I'd suggest adding your name to the Title field. Commit that change.

8. Visit <username>.github.io in your browser. Again, <username> should be replaced with your own username. I.e. walshbr.github.io for walshbr. You've got a portfolio live and on the internet! 
  
9. Any future changes can be made with the same workflow. Make a couple more. 

10. Time permitting, introduce CSS and make a change there as well.
